Using GitHub's project management features—milestones, issues, and project boards—can significantly improve team collaboration and project organization by providing a clear structure for task management and progress tracking. Milestones help break down the project into manageable phases with specific goals and deadlines.
Issues are essential for identifying and tracking individual tasks, bugs, or feature requests. Each issue can be detailed with specific instructions, assigned to team members, and prioritized, ensuring that no task is overlooked. 
The project board offers a visual representation of progress, where issues move through columns like “To Do,” “In Progress,” and “Done.” This board serves as a live overview of the project’s status, making it easier for the team to see what tasks are in progress and what still needs attention. It also allows team members to easily claim or update tasks and communicate any roadblocks in real time.
However, challenges may arise, particularly in ensuring that all team members actively update the project board and issue statuses. It requires regular monitoring and discipline to keep the board up to date.
